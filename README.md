## About:

Hello. My name is Paul Marcu, and I'm a graduate of [Babe»ô-Bolyai University](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/)'s Computer Science program. Currently, I'm enrolled in a Master's Degree program focusing on [High-Performance Computing and Big Data Analytics](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/invatamant/programe-academice/masterat/calcul-de-inalta-performanta-si-analiza-volumelor-mari-de-date/) at the same institution. I seek to deepen my knowledge of and experience with software development, from both a professional and an academic perspective.

I have the greatest amount of experience with strongly-typed object-oriented programming languages, primarily `Java`, `C#` and `C++`, although I have also worked a considerable amount with other types of languages, such as `Python`, `Javascript`, `PHP`, `HTML` and `LISP`, among others. In terms of software design, I'm most familiar with **backend development** and **standalone app development**.

To contact me, you can message me here on GitHub, or over on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-marcu/). Have a nice day. :+1:
